# Task 28: Monitoring and Alerting Setup

## Priority: High

## Description
Implement comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting for the production deployment, including performance metrics, error tracking, and uptime monitoring.

## Dependencies
- Task 27: Deno Deploy (completed)
- Task 07: Logging System (completed)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Metrics Collection**
   - Request count per endpoint
   - Response time percentiles
   - Error rates by type
   - Memory usage
   - Active connections

2. **Structured Logging**
   ```typescript
   {
     timestamp: ISO8601,
     level: "info|warn|error",
     requestId: UUID,
     method: "POST",
     path: "/api/webflow-form",
     duration: 234,
     status: 200,
     error?: ErrorDetails
   }
   ```

3. **Error Tracking**
   - Capture stack traces
   - Group similar errors
   - Track error frequency
   - Alert on thresholds
   - Include context

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - API response times
   - Webflow API latency
   - Processing duration
   - Queue lengths
   - Memory trends

5. **Alerting Rules**
   - Error rate > 5%
   - Response time > 2s
   - Memory usage > 80%
   - Webflow API failures
   - Rate limit warnings

6. **Dashboard Setup**
   - Request volume graph
   - Error rate chart
   - Response time histogram
   - Success rate gauge
   - Recent errors list

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Metrics collected
- [ ] Logs structured
- [ ] Alerts configured
- [ ] Dashboard created
- [ ] Performance tracked
- [ ] Errors captured

## Time Estimate: 4 hours
