# Task 07: Logging System Implementation

## Priority: High

## Description
Implement a comprehensive logging system for request/response tracking, error logging, and debugging. The system should support different log levels and formats for development and production environments.

## Dependencies
- Task 01: Project Setup (completed)
- Task 02: Development Environment (completed)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create Logger Utility**
   - Create `src/utils/logger.ts`
   - Implement log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
   - Add timestamp formatting
   - Include request ID tracking

2. **Request Logger Middleware**
   - Create `src/middleware/requestLogger.ts`
   - Log incoming requests (method, path, headers)
   - Log response status and timing
   - Implement request ID generation
   - Add body logging (with sensitive data masking)

3. **Error Logging**
   - Integrate with error handler middleware
   - Log stack traces in development
   - Sanitize error messages for production
   - Include request context in error logs

4. **Log Formatting**
   - JSON format for production (structured logging)
   - Pretty print for development
   - Include metadata (environment, version, host)
   - Support log correlation IDs

5. **Performance Logging**
   - Track request duration
   - Log slow requests (>1000ms)
   - Memory usage tracking
   - API call timing

6. **Log Management**
   - Implement log rotation (if file-based)
   - Configure log levels via environment
   - Add health check logging
   - Implement sensitive data filtering

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All requests and responses logged
- [ ] Error logging with context
- [ ] Request IDs for tracing
- [ ] Performance metrics captured
- [ ] Sensitive data properly masked
- [ ] Different formats for dev/prod

## Time Estimate: 3 hours
