## Rollback Plan

1. **Immediate Rollback Triggers**
   - Error rate >10%
   - Response time >2s consistently
   - Memory usage growing unbounded
   - Critical functionality broken

2. **Rollback Procedure**
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous deployment
   deployctl deploy --prod --rollback
   
   # Verify rollback
   curl https://api.example.com/health
   ```

3. **Post-Rollback Actions**
   - Investigate root cause
   - Fix issues in staging
   - Re-test thoroughly
   - Schedule new deployment
