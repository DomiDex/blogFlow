## Implementation Order

The recommended implementation order follows the task numbering, with some tasks that can be done in parallel:

1. **Foundation Phase** (Tasks 01-05): Must be completed first
2. **Core Infrastructure** (Tasks 06-10): Can be done mostly in parallel
3. **Webflow Integration** (Tasks 11-15): Sequential, builds on each other
4. **Content Processing** (Tasks 16-20): Can be done in parallel with some dependencies
5. **Business Logic** (Tasks 21-23): Can be done in parallel
6. **Testing** (Tasks 24-26): After main implementation
7. **Deployment** (Tasks 27-30): Final phase
8. **Checklist** (Task 99): Final verification

## Total Time Estimate

- Foundation: 15 hours
- Core Infrastructure: 16 hours
- Webflow Integration: 22 hours
- Content Processing: 17 hours
- Business Logic: 6 hours
- Testing: 14 hours
- Deployment: 15 hours
- Final Checklist: 2 hours

**Total: ~107 hours**

## Critical Path

The critical path (tasks that must be done sequentially):
1. Project Setup (01)
2. Type Definitions (04)
3. Webflow API Client (11)
4. CMS Operations (12)
5. Integration Tests (25)
6. Deno Deploy (27)
7. Deployment Checklist (99)

## Notes

- Tasks marked as "Critical" priority should be completed first within their phase
- Some tasks can be implemented by different team members in parallel
- Testing should be ongoing throughout development, not just at the end
- Each task includes acceptance criteria that must be met before marking complete
