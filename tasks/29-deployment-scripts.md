## Priority: Medium

## Description
Create utility scripts for deployment, testing, environment validation, and operational tasks to streamline development and deployment workflows.

## Dependencies

5. **Utility Scripts**
   ```typescript
   scripts/generate-types.ts
   scripts/validate-deps.ts
   scripts/clean.ts
   scripts/backup-env.ts
   ```

6. **CI/CD Integration**
   ```yaml
   # GitHub Actions example
   - Check code quality
   - Run tests
   - Deploy preview
   - Deploy production
   ```
